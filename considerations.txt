Tabulations: 
1 | Total number of posts
2 | Total number of unique authors
3 | Average post length (measured in word count)
4 | Date range of the dataset
5 | Top 20 most important words in the posts (selftext


0 | General Considerations: 
    Why use Pandas?
    - Its speed and efficiency is sufficient for tabulations 1-5

1 | Total number of posts
    Assumptions:
    - [deleted] differs from [removed]
    How do we address [deleted] and [removed] posts?
    - I decided to come up with totals of all these numbers
      since the title data may still be important for analysis
      (though there are questions as to whether removed posts
      should be used at all in analysis)

3 | Average post length (measured in word count)
    Assumptions:
    - numbers count as words
    What "clean-up" was done?
    - exclude [removed] and [deleted] posts from avg post length
      calculations
    - exclude emojis and punctuation
      ex: "I like [smilelyFaceEmoji] cats ?!" has 3 words
    - reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47464658/python-efficient-way-to-remove-emojis-and-some-punctuation-from-a-large-dataset

4 | Date range of the dataset
    Assumptions:
    - included [removed] and [deleted] posts in calculation assuming
      that data will be important for analysis
    Clean-up:
    - There was one line with the url in the date column. For now 
      I just skipped over it.
